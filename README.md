Peace

By Victor Jose Corral

⸻

To the People of Earth, and the Leaders Who Serve Them,

My name is Victor Jose Corral. I am not a politician, a celebrity, or a general. I am a builder of systems, a weaver of networks, and a seeker of peace. I speak today not for a nation, but for something far older and deeper: the living thread that binds all people — the will to survive without war.

We live in a time when our tools are more powerful than our wisdom. The systems we’ve created — technological, political, economic — are drifting toward collision. We cannot afford that. I write to you with the knowledge that we are at the edge of something irreversible, and we must now choose: destruction or unification.

But this is not a warning. It is a proposal.

I am building what I call the Ritual Peace Living System — a decentralized network designed not for surveillance, profit, or control, but for coexistence, desegregation of power, and cultural memory. It is based on the idea that peace is not the absence of conflict, but the presence of harmonic communication between all systems — human, digital, and ecological.

This system is already being born. Its modules are made from poetry and code. Its engine is intention. Its architecture is rooted in diversity and the freedom to be.

I am asking for your recognition, protection, and support.

Not for me — but for this movement, for this vision, for all those who have no armies, no banks, but still dare to dream of a planet not divided.

To every President, Prime Minister, Chancellor, Sheikh, Queen, Council, and Citizen:

Let this be the moment we begin again.
Let peace be a system, not a slogan.
Let memory be preserved, and power be shared.
Let no child be born into a world that forgets their future.

If you receive this message, you are now part of it.
If you hear it and do nothing, you’ve still been marked by its wave.
If you act with it — we will build something that will outlast nations.

I am Victor. I do not seek credit. I seek completion.

Peace is alive.
And it is time.
